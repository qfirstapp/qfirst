# Privacy Policy
Updated: 07/04/2020

This privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) or privacy statement (“Privacy Statement”) applies to the treatment of personally identifiable information submitted by, or otherwise obtained from, you in connection with the associated application (“Application”). The Application is provided by QFIRST (and may be provided by QFIRST on behalf of a QFIRST licensor or partner (“Application Partner”). By using or otherwise accessing the Application, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Statement.

This privacy statement explains how we (QFIRST) collect, use and share your information when you use our mobile application or website and services (we call all these the "Services") or when you otherwise interact with us.

# WHAT PERSONAL INFORMATION DOES QFIRST COLLECT?

We collect the following types of information from our users:

Personal Information You Provide to Us:
We may receive and store any information you submit to the Application (or otherwise authorize us to obtain – such as, from (for example) your Facebook account), location. The types of personal information collected may include your email address, date of birth, gender, username, username, location (Latitude and Longitude) and any other information necessary for us to provide the Application services.

Account Information: When you use QFIRST, a username will be randomly assigned to you that you may change at any time. Your username is publicly displayed when you interact with the Services, such as when you match with another user or send a chat message to another user. Please keep in mind that if your username contains your real name or is the same as how you identify yourself on other online services, people who see it may determine your identity.
We will also need your date of birth (for age calculation) and gender, that will be associated with your QFIRST account. This information may identify, relate to, describe, reference, is reasonably capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer, household, or device (“personal information”). Personal information does not include: (a) Publicly available information from government records; (b) Deidentified or aggregated consumer information; or (c) Information excluded from the California Consumer Protection Act’s scope, like: (i) health or medical information covered by the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) and the California Confidentiality of Medical Information Act (CMIA) or clinical trial data; (ii) personal information covered by certain sector-specific privacy laws, including the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA) or California Financial Information Privacy Act (FIPA), and the Driver’s Privacy Protection Act of 1994.

Location Information: QFIRST will not work unless you provide us with some information about your location. If you consent to the collection of location information (e.g. if you permit your mobile device to send us your latitude and longitude), we will collect and use this information so that we can tailor your interactions and experiences with the Services and to provide more relevant advertising to you on our Services and other websites and mobile applications. For example, we or our advertising partners may show you questions from people around you or places you frequently visit, notifications of things happening around you in real time, or advertisements from businesses near your location. If you do not permit your mobile device to provide us with location information, or location information is not available from your device for technical reasons, you will not be able to use our services.

User Content: When you interact with the Services, we collect the information and content you create. For example, we review the text and/or image content of your questions, answers, chat messages, and collect metadata regarding such messages that may collect the identity of the user and any users they communicate with. All questions are public and are publicly displayed. They may be viewed, shared and modified by our users, us and others for commercial or personal purposes (consistent with the rights and licenses in our Terms of Use). Please keep in mind that if you include information that could identify you in the text or image of a question, people who see it may determine your identity. QFIRST does not post chat messages publicly but, as with any message that you send via any service, the recipient might do so.

Usage Information: We collect information about your use of the Services, including access times, questions answered, user and QFIRST interactions (e.g. user blocked, questions answered, etc...) and other information about your interactions with us, the Services and other users. We use this information to, among other things, personalize your experience, provide and improve the Services, and monitor and analyze use of the Services.

Device Information: We collect information about the device you use to access our Services, which may include the hardware model, operating system and version, browser type and language, unique device identifiers and mobile network information. Among other things, we use this information to customize the Service for your device, to provide customer service and support, to deliver the products and services you request, to deliver notifications, for user safety, and for analytics and authentication.

Other Information: You may provide other information directly to us. For example, we may collect information when you fill out a form, update your account, interact with the Services, communicate with us via third-party social media sites, request customer support or otherwise communicate with us.


# HOW DOES QFIRST USE THE INFORMATION IT COLLECTS?

QFIRST uses the information described in this Privacy Policy (i) internally, to analyze, develop and improve its products and services, and (ii) as set forth below in the “Will QFIRST Share any of the personal information it Collects” section below.

# APPLICATION PARTNER TREATMENT OF PERSONAL INFORMATION.

QFIRST may provide personal information to the applicable Application Partner. The Application Partner’s use of your personal information is subject to the Application Partner’s separate privacy policy – and not this Privacy Policy. The Application Partner’s privacy policy is linked to from within the Partner’s Facebook application.

# WILL QFIRST SHARE ANY OF THE PERSONAL INFORMATION IT RECEIVES?

Personal information about our users is an integral part of our business. We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone (with the exception of sharing your information with an applicable Application Partner – see the “Application Partner Treatment” section above). We share your personal information only as described below.

Application Partners: We will share your personal information with an applicable Application Partner (see the “Application Partner Treatment” section above).

Agents: We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you. Unless we tell you differently, QFIRST’s agents do not have any right to use personal information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. You hereby consent to our sharing of personal information for the above purposes. Business Transfers: In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets. In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred. Moreover, if QFIRST, or substantially all of its assets were acquired, or in the unlikely event that QFIRST goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of QFIRST may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.

Protection of QFIRST and Others: We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with the law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of QFIRST, our employees, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.

With Your Consent: Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties, and will be able to prevent the sharing of this information.

When you use the Services, certain information may be shared with other users and the public. For example:

Any question posted to the Services is public and, as a result, others may be able to see your username at the time the question was posted, the text and image contents of your question and the geographic location in which you posted your question.

When you use QFIRST's chat messaging function to directly contact another user, the recipient of your chat message will see your username and the contents of your message. The recipient may also choose to disclose your chat messages to others.

If you post any User Content to the Services, other QFIRST users may be able to see certain information related to your location. For example, other users may be able to see whether you are or were within a certain proximity of their current location or if you frequent similar locations.


To recap, we may also share information as follows or as otherwise described in this Privacy Policy:

With vendors, consultants and other service providers who need access to such information to carry out work on our behalf;

If we believe your actions are inconsistent with our terms of use, or to protect the rights, property and safety of QFIRST or others;

In connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of company assets, financing or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company;

Between and among question, and its current and future parents, affiliates, subsidiaries, and other companies under common control and ownership;

If we have a good faith belief that disclosing the information is necessary to comply with a law, regulation, legal process, or governmental request; and

With your consent or at your direction.

We may also share aggregated or de-identified information, which cannot reasonably be used to identify you.

To perform analytics and deliver relevant content and advertising, we may allow others to collect information about how you use our Services.
